### 👋 Hi, I'm Georgii!

💻 I currently work as a DevOps and Infrastructure Engineer, while also serving as a full-stack developer with expertise in UI/UX and software architecture.

📱 In my free time, I focus on iOS development. I have over 3 years of experience in Swift & SwiftUI, including working with networking, caching, animations, and more. In all my UI-related projects, I pay a lot of attention to even the smallest details, animations, interactions and overall user experience.

✉️ Feel free to contact me on [Telegram](https://t.me/alx_io) or via [email](mailto:geoalx@icloud.com) if you have any questions.
